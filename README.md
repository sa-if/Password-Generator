## Features 🙌🏻

<h4 align="ceter">C++</h4>

- `Generates a random password of a specified length using a given character set`
- `Assigns a score to the password based on various criteria`
- `Continues to generate new passwords until it finds one with a sufficiently high score`
- `Allows the user to specify the length and character set of the generated password at runtime`


<h4 align="ceter">Java</h4>

- `Generates a random password of specified length`
- `Option to include special characters in the password`
- `Option to include digits in the password`
- `Specify the number of special characters and digits to include in the password`
- `Uses the SecureRandom class to generate a secure, random password`
- `Returns the generated password as a string`


## Usage/Examples 🎃


<h4 align="ceter">To run this script of C++, you will need to follow these steps:</h4>




```text
Run the following command on PowerShell:
 1. Ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed on your system
 2. Save the script to a file with a .cpp extension, such as password_generator.cpp
 3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script
 4. Compile the script using the C++ compiler. For example, if you are using the GNU C++ compiler, you can use the following command:
    g++ password_generator.cpp -o password_generator
 5. This will create an executable file called password_generator.
 6. Run the executable file by typing ./password_generator and pressing Enter.
 7. Enter the desired values and press Enter.
 8. The program will then generate and print a password.💥💥

```
  
<h4 align="ceter">To run this script of Java, you will need to follow these steps:</h4>

```text

1. Import the java.util.Scanner, java.security.SecureRandom, and java.util.Arrays classes.
2. Create an instance of the PasswordGenerator class.
3. Call the generatePassword method on the PasswordGenerator instance, passing in the desired parameters for the password.
4. The generatePassword method will return a string that represents the generated password. You can store this string in a variable or use it as needed.
```



## Here is an example of how you might use this script:
      
```Java

PasswordGenerator generator = new PasswordGenerator();
String password = generator.generatePassword(10, true, true, 2, 2);
System.out.println("Generated password: " + password);

```
