- `Allows the user to specify the length and character set of the generated password at runtime`



## Usage/Examples 🎃


To run this script, you will need to follow these steps:

- `Ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed on your system`
- `Save the script to a file with a .cpp extension, such as password_generator.cpp`
- `Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script`
- `Compile the script using the C++ compiler. For example, if you are using the GNU C++ compiler, you can use the following command:
  g++ password_generator.cpp -o password_generator`
- `This will create an executable file called password_generator.`
- `Run the executable file by typing ./password_generator and pressing Enter. The program will prompt you to enter the length and character set of the password you want to generate.
  Enter the desired values and press Enter. The program will then generate and print a password.💥💥`
