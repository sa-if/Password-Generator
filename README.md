## features 🙌🏻

<h2 align="ceter">C++</h2>

- `Generates a random password of a specified length using a given character set`
- `Assigns a score to the password based on various criteria`
- `Continues to generate new passwords until it finds one with a sufficiently high score`
- `Allows the user to specify the length and character set of the generated password at runtime`


<h2 align="ceter">Java</h2>

- `Generates a random password of specified length`
- `Option to include special characters in the password`
- `Option to include digits in the password`
- `Specify the number of special characters and digits to include in the password`
- `Uses the SecureRandom class to generate a secure, random password`
- `Returns the generated password as a string`


## Usage/Examples 🎃


To run this script of C++, you will need to follow these steps:

- `Ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed on your system`
- `Save the script to a file with a .cpp extension, such as password_generator.cpp`
- `Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script`
- `Compile the script using the C++ compiler. For example, if you are using the GNU C++ compiler, you can use the following command:
  g++ password_generator.cpp -o password_generator`
- `This will create an executable file called password_generator.`
- `Run the executable file by typing ./password_generator and pressing Enter.
- ` Enter the desired values and press Enter.`
- `The program will then generate and print a password.💥💥`
  
To run this script of Java, you will need to follow these steps:
- `Import the java.util.Scanner, java.security.SecureRandom, and java.util.Arrays classes.`
- `Create an instance of the PasswordGenerator class.`
- `Call the generatePassword method on the PasswordGenerator instance, passing in the desired parameters for the password.`
- `The generatePassword method will return a string that represents the generated password. You can store this string in a variable or use it as needed.`
- Here is an example of how you might use this script:
        `PasswordGenerator generator = new PasswordGenerator();
           String password = generator.generatePassword(10, true, true, 2, 2);
           System.out.println("Generated password: " + password);`
